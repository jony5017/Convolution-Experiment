After 5 times, the image keeps almost the same, but image size still goes down according to the formulation ( (n + 2p - f) / S + 1) x ( (n + 2p - f) / S + 1). Since the padding=0, stride=1, it's easy to get the image size after convolution. Why do we get this? Because the filter will filter some features and strengthen some features. If you build up the feature again and again, you will almost only see this feature and cannot see other features.
