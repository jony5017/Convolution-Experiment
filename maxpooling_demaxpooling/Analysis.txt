1, with the increasement of maxpool stride, the image goes smaller, but it still keeps most of the features, that's why we use max pooling to reduce parameters in cnn.
2, as we can see, demaxpool can recover most of the features, and filter size=2 is better than filter size=3, because after maxpool, they have almost the same image size, but in demaxpool, filter size=2 image is more smooth and clear.
